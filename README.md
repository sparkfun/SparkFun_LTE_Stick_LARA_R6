[*SparkFun LTE Stick - LARA-R6 (CEL-23618)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/23618)

The SparkFun LTE Stick provides a development and prototyping platform for the LARA-R6 LTE Cat 1 module from u-blox<sup>&trade;</sup>. The LTE Stick uses the LARA-R6401 version, which supports both data and voice for North America and works with LTE bands used by these mobile networks: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and FirstNet. The board includes a nanoSIM card slot for users to select their preferred network. Check with your network provider for compatibility with the LARA-R6.

The LTE Stick routes the UART and I<sup>2</sup>S interfaces to a 0.1in.-spaced plated-through-hole (PTH) header along with the Reset and Power On signals. The board has two SMA connectors for the LARA-R6's primary and secondary antennas. The primary antenna sends and receives data, whereas the secondary antenna is receive only. Power to the board is provided either over the USB-C connector (recommended) or the VIN PTH pin (<b>6V Max</b>). The board defaults to use the higher voltage input. The board also includes test points for advanced users to solder to for the I<sup>2</sup>C interface, secondary UART, and four GPIO pins (IO1, IO2, IO3, and IO6).
