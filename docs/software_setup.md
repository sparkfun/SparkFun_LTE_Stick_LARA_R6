## SparkFun u-blox Cellular Arduino Library

The SparkFun u-blox Cellular Arduino Library is a generic AT command-set library that works with multiple u-blox cellular modules that share the same [AT Command Set](). This includes the LARA-R6 on this board as well as the SARA-R5 and others. Most of the examples are generic and work with all modules but some require selecting a specific module to function properly.

Download the library through the Arduino Library Manager tool by searching for <b>"SparkFun u-blox Cellular"</b> and download the latest version. Users who prefer to install it manually can download it from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_Cellular_Arduino_Library) or by clicking the button below:

</center>

With the library installed, let's move on to taking a closer look at a few of the examples included in it.
